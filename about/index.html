      <h1><a href='/'>Boggle</a></h1>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Boggle</a> is a word
      game in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent
      letters. Unlike the numerous other online implementations of the Boggle
      game (which are often released under various different names to avoid
      trademark infringement), <a href="/boggle/">this application</a> exists to
      provide a lightweight, minimalistic user interface and power-user
      features which aim to help a player improve.</p>

      <p>Boggle can be played on <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">"any modern
      browser or device"</a>. The implementation relies on the <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">
      Service Worker API</a> to ensure it will work completely offline, and
      can be installed to one's desktop or phone home screen if desired.</p>

      <p>The Boggle application opens to a menu, providing the options to
      <a href="#play"><b>play</b></a> a game, <a href="#train"><b>train</b></a>
      your vocabulary, <a href="#define"><b>define</b></a> a word, view
      <a href="#stats"><b>stats</b></a> from past games, or change the
      <a href="#settings"><b>settings</b></a>.</p>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/menu.png" height=320 /></div>

      <h3 id="play">Play</h3>

      <p>While <b>playing</b>, the standard 3 minute timer ticks down. The
      timer will automatically pause if the player navigates away from the
      board outside of viewing the score breakdown or 'define' functionality.
      Furthermore, the timer state can be toggled manually at any point by
      simply by clicking on it. A player can navigate back to the main menu by
      using the icon in the top left corner which can also be long pressed to
      cause a 'refresh' which will end the current game and begin a new one
      with a randomly generated board (alternatively, going back to the menu
      and clicking 'New Game' as opposed to 'Resume' will also trigger a
      refresh). In the top right corner the player's current score is
      displayed. Words may be entered on a touch device by touching letters on
      the board and dragging across the tiles to complete words - once the
      touch ends the word is considered finished. On devices with a keyboard,
      words may be entered simply by typing, the '<tt>Enter</tt>' or
      '<tt>Space</tt>' key can be used to complete the word.</p>

      <div class="i">
        <img src="img/touch.gif" height=320 />
        <img src="img/refresh.gif" height=320 />
      </div>

      <p>By default, after a word has been entered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if the word is valid and has not yet been played a definition for
          the word will be displayed and persist until another word has been
          entered</li>
        <li>if the word is valid and has already been played, or the word is
          shorter than the configured minimum word size the word will disappear
          immediately after being played</li>
        <li>if the word is invalid the word will flash red and disappear</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="i">
        <img src="img/5x5-overtime.gif" height=320 />
        <img src="img/failure-and-reentry.gif" height=320 />
      </div>

      <p>The application allows words to be entered even after the timer has
      expired, though it keeps track of which words were entered before the
      game's duration elapsed and scores them separately (see example above).
      </p>

      <p>The application also provides some '<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user">power user</a>'
      features during gameplay in the form of <b>shortcuts</b> and heatmap
      hints. To simplify and expedite word entry, given that the minimum length
      of word supported by the application is 2 letters, anytime a 1 or 2
      letter word is played the game will interpret it as if it were intended
      to be appended as a suffix to the word which had just been entered
      previously (the 'ING' suffix is also handled as a special case for this
      shortcut). The most common use case for this is quickly entering plurals
      of words (~50% of all valid words are plurals), though any suffixes can
      take advantage of the shortcut:</p>

      <div class="i">
        <img src="img/shortcut.gif" height=320 />
        <img src="img/heatmap.gif" height=320 />
      </div>

      <p>The <b>heatmap</b> hint feature is more situational - during game
      play, a player may long press the score displayed in the top right corner
      to cause the application to colour the tiles based on how frequently they
      occur (more precisely, the points the tile is involved in) in the
      remaining possible words that can be played. The tiles opacity is
      weighted such that those which are present in words forming the most
      points in aggregate will show up in the most opaque red for the duration
      of the press. While there are some rare edge cases when words may be
      found more than one way on a given board, in general the heatmap can be
      used to help a player determine where to focus their search to maximize
      their score.</p>

      <h3 id="score">Score</h3>

      <p>Clicking on the <b>score</b> (as opposed to long pressing it) will instead
      display a full breakdown of which words were played, for the current game
      and for each game that has ever been played by the user in reverse
      chronological order.</p>

      <div class="i"><img class="nooutline" src="img/score-breakdown.png" height=250 /></div>

      <p>Each game's ID can be seen in the list, though only the current game's
      'Played' section will be expanded by default, other games or sections can
      be expanded or collapsed via clicking on them. A game's ID contains
      information about the dice configuration, minimum board size, dictionary
      and the random seed used to generate the board - this ID can be shared
      with another player for them to be able to play the same board and compare
      results. Alongside the ID is the players total score (irrespective of the
      timer) for the game compared to their configured 'goal' score (also
      rendered as a percentage).</p>

      <p>The 'Played' section summary contains several metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <b>potential score</b> (in parentheses) the player could have
          had if they had played all of the words described next (note: a word
          will only be counted in the first group it falls into)</li>
        <li>the total number (not points) of <b>suffixes</b> that were missed,
          computed roughly by determining which of the player's words could
          also have had <tt>S</tt>, <tt>ED</tt>, <tt>ER</tt>, or <tt>ING</tt>
          applied to them to form further valid words.  This is sometimes
          misleading as these suffixes may actual form completely new valid
          words which aren't actually extensions stemming from the original
          root (eg. <tt>BAS &#x1f852; BASS</tt> or <tt>SAT &#x1f852; SATED</tt>),
          but in general works as a good enough heuristic</li>
        <li>the number of <b>subwords</b> of words played which were not played
          themselves (eg. if <tt>SETA</tt> was played without
          <tt>ETA</tt>)</li>
        <li>the number of <b>anagrams</b> of words played which were not played
          themselves though were present in the board</li>
        <li>the ratio of <b>invalid</b> words played versus the <b>total</b>
          number of words (invalid and valid) played (also in parentheses)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These summary metrics can be completely ignored, but they may also
      serve as helpful metrics for players looking to improve their play and
      detect weaknesses. Finally, the 'Possible' section summary simply lists
      the total number of points attainable using only words of a specific grade
      level or below, ie. '<tt>D / C / B / A (S)</tt>'. Due to the nature of the grading
      system, the final score in parentheses also indicates the highest possible
      score for the given board in question.</p>

      <p>Upon expanding the 'Played' section, words played by the user are
      listed in the order that they were entered, along with any definitions.
      Invalid words show up in red and words which are of a higher grade level
      than the goal grade configured by the user show up in grey.</p>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/score.gif" height=320 /></div>

      <p>The 'Possible' section lists all of the words possible in the board
      which were not already played by the user, though these are sorted by a
      more complicated procedure: words which were determined as 'missed'
      (suffixes/subwords/anagrams as described above in the section on 'Played'
      metrics) are shown at the top (and underlined), then the words are sorted
      by grade, length, grouped together with their anagrams and then sorted
      alphabetically. This sort order attempts to make it easy for a player to
      prioritize learning which words were overlooked.</p>

      <h3 id="define">Define</h3>

      <p>By either navigating through the main menu, swiping left or right
      anywhere in the application outside of the game board, or by using the
      '<tt>?</tt>' keyboard shortcut the '<b>define</b>' panel can be pulled
      up:</p>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/define.gif" height=320 /></div>

      <p>Words will be defined immediately as they are typed. Words that are
      recognized in certain configurations but not the current configuration
      will be greyed out. In addition to definitions, all valid anagrams of the
      search term will be displayed (and may be clicked to link to their
      definition), as will various statistics for the defined word:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Grade:</b> words are assigned an artificial grade <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Japan">(S,
          A, B, C, D)</a> meant to reflect their difficulty/importance based
          on the frequency they occur in the English language and how
          frequently they show up in Boggle games. Each grade corresponds
          roughly 20 percentile points worth of 'weight', eg. a player who
          knows all B, C and D (and no S or A)  tier words would be expected to
          roughly recognize 60% of the possible points on any given Boggle
          board.</li>
        <li><b>Frequency:</b> the percentile ranking of the word in the English
          language, based on <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-gram data provided by
          Peter Norvig</a> and frequency lists from the <a
          href="http://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html">British National
          Corpus</a>, where a lower percentile means the word is more common.
          While this frequency data needs to be taken with a grain of salt, it does
          an OK job of separating more regular words from those that are truly
          esoteric.</li>
        <li><b>Score:</b> the percentile ranking of the word based on its expected
          number of points per game (see <a href="#strategy">below</a> for a further elaboration on this
          concept).</li>
        <li><b>Anagram:</b> the percentile ranking of the word based on the expected
          number of points per game for it and all of its anagrams.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A user can return out of define mode either by swiping left or right
      or hitting the 'Escape' key. Hitting 'Space' or 'Enter' once will clear
      the current query, hitting it a second time will leave define mode.</p>

      <h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>

      <p>To further aid with post game analysis, a '<b>stats</b>' breakdown of
      commonly missed words, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anadrome">
      anadromes</a> and anagram pairs from recent games can be accessed by via
      the main application menu.</p>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/stats.gif" height=320 /></div>

      <p>The sort order for these tables attempts to surface words worth the
      most points per game that have been missed most recently. The 'Word' tab
      shows the commonly missed words and how often they have been found
      relative to how often they were possible, the 'Pair' tab shows how often
      one direction of an anadrome pair has been found relative to another
      compared to the total amount either have been found, and the 'Anagram'
      tab shows how often a specific word has been found relative to how often
      it has been present compared to the stats of its anagrams.</p>

      <h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/settings.gif" height=320 /></div>

      <p>At the the of the <b>settings</b> pane is a game <b>ID</b>
      (which, as described <a href="#score">above</a>, contains information
      about the the dice configuration, minimum board size, dictionary and the
      random seed used to generate the board) is displayed and can be edited
      manually, though as the various setting options are toggled the seed
      updates itself to reflect the changes. By default, the ID shown is the ID
      of the current game, but if there is no current game or the ID has been
      modified while there is still an active game the ID reflects what the
      <em>next</em> game's ID will be (i.e. you must click 'New Game' to have
      the changed settings applied).</p>

      <p>The Boggle board game has been released with various <b>dice
      configurations</b> over the years. This implementation supports the
      three most common English <a href="http://www.luke-g.com/boggle/dice.html">
      dice distributions</a>, including the 5x5 distribution for 'Big Boggle'.
      The 6x6 'Super Big Boggle' distribution is not supported.</p>

      <p>4x4 configurations of Boggle typically mandate that a legal word must
      be at least 3 characters long, with the 5x5 Big Boggle further restricting
      the legal word size to at least 4 characters. This implementation follows
      these defaults, but also allows the player to change the <b>minimum word
      length</b> restriction independent of board size, allowing 3, 4, or 5
      letter words to be the minimum allowed.</p>

      <p>Boggle has no official <b>dictionary</b>, so instead this
      implementation relies on the three canonical Scrabble word lists - <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASPA_Word_List">NWL</a> (formerly
      known as 'TWL', more restrictive, used in American and Canadian Scrabble
      tournaments), <a
      href="https://everything2.com/title/ENABLE+word+list">ENABLE</a> (similar
      to NWL, used by a large number of online games), and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words">CSW</a>
      (formerly known as 'SOWPODS' the most permissive word list, used by Scrabble
      players outside of North America). By default, the NWL is used (though it is
      important to note that due to availability all definitions come from CSW
      which may sometimes be a source of confusion).</p>

      <p>The <b>grade</b> toggle simply allows a player to choose which grade
      (as described in detail <a href="#define">above</a>) best reflects the
      breadth of their vocabulary and is only used for display purposes when
      determining goal points or visually styling words.</p>

      <div class="i">
        <img src="img/hide.gif" height=320 />
        <img src="img/full.gif" height=320 />
      </div>

      <p>The <b>display</b> toggle changes how much information the player sees
      during a game. The 'Hide' mode more accurately reflects how games are
      played in real life - all words entered will disappear immediately
      instead of lingering with a definition if they were valid or displaying
      in red if they were invalid, and the current score is not displayed at
      all times. To find out these details the user must navigate to the
      scoring breakdown. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the 'Full'
      display mode which pulls out the metrics from the scoring breakdown and
      places them front and center for easy access while playing. From left to
      right, the potential score, number of missed suffixes, number of missed
      subwords, number of missed anagrams, points scored, goal score and
      percentage of goal score are displayed (a hybrid of what is displayed
      alongside game ID in the scoring breakdown and the 'Played' section
      summary).</p>

      <p>Finally, light and dark <b>themes</b> are supported for the
      application, though the application will respect the system's default
      preference until it is overwritten in the settings.</p>

      <h3 id="settings">Training</h3>

      <div class="i"><img src="img/training.gif" height=320 /></div>

      <p>The final feature the application provides is a '<b>training</b>'
      mode, accessible via the main menu or <a href="#setting">settings</a>.
      Training mode determines which anagrams to present to the user based on
      the settings configured in the settings pane and past training sessions
      and effectively amounts to 'anagram <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">>flashcards</a>' - users
      are tested with a jumble of letters to form words out of and by
      touching anywhere on the screen they can see all of the possible valid
      words and their definitions. At the bottom of the answer card users are
      asked to assign a rating to how well they remembered the card - the
      application will use this rating and the user's past ratings of this
      anagram group to determine when it will next be tested. A recommended
      rubric for assigning the numerical ratings based on the
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2">original paper</a>
      for the algorithm is as follows:</p>

      <table id="rating">
        <tr><td>5</td><td>perfect response <em>(obvious, knew words and exact number in group immediately)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>correct response after a hesitation <em>(default correct rating, able to name entire group)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>correct response recalled with serious difficulty <em>(took a long time, possibly required size hint or named words not in the group)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall <em>(~80% or more of the group remembered fairly easily, missing words familiar)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>incorrect response; the correct one remembered <em>(default incorrect rating, no words seem completely foreign)</em></td></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>complete blackout <em>(less than 20-30% of words remembered and some words totally unrecognized)</em></td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>New anagram groups are introduced in order of priority based on their
      expected points per game (based on the settings configuration), and the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>
      algorithm used is a modification of those used by existing memorization
      software applications like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>,
      <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>,
      <a href="https://quizlet.com/en-gb">Quizlet</a> or

      specific word study software exists (eg. 'NASPA Zyzzyva' or 'Scrabble
      Expert'), but none leverage the expected points per game data available
      in Boggle to focus on the most important words. A detailed description of
      how the training algorithm works can be found in the <a

      <p>The user's progress is displayed in two parts in the top right corner
      of training mode - the number of overdue anagram groups vs. the total
      number of groups the user has trained on. Similar to the 'heatmap' hint
      during game play, the progress indicator can be long pressed to reveal a
      hint indicating the number of valid words that are possible to form by
      unscrambling the letters being tested. By simply clicking on the progress
      instead of long pressing, a '<b>review</b>' page where anagram groups
      which are currently troublesome to the user is displayed.</p>

      <h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>

      <p>The core skill in most word games (eg. Boggle, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a>, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananagrams">Bananagrams</a>) is
      being able to find possible words from a jumble of letters - that is, to
      determine valid anagrams. Having a substantive vocabulary is important,
      but the type of vocabulary required is vastly different than the type of
      vocabulary that may be useful for passing the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT#Writing_and_Language_Test">SAT</a>
      or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations">GRE</a>
      - long words occur with significantly less regularity. Shorter words,
      particularly those involving specific letters, tend to be the most valuable
      to focus one's studying on.</p>

      <p>In Bananagrams and Scrabble, knowledge of 2-letter words is incredibly
      important as it allows much more flexibility in playing longer words
      alongside those which already exist. Memorizing all valid 2-letter
      words is actually fairly straightforward, <a
      href="https://tomre.es/post/hacking-scrabble-part-2/">Tom Rees outlines
      a way of remembering them</a> through use of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic">mnemonics</a>, an
      example of which (updated for NWL 2019) can be found below:</p>

      <table id="mnemonic">
        <tr><td>dumpy biz thankful</td><td>a</td><td>birthdays mangle wax</td></tr>
        <tr><td>few behind him party</td><td>e</td><td>homosexual snowdrifts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>quake halts bag mixup</td><td>i</td><td>infested</td></tr>
        <tr><td>midnight jeep bylaws</td><td>o</td><td>murky pushdown fix</td></tr>
        <tr><td>x-men</td><td>u</td><td>phantoms </td></tr>
        <tr><td>mm hm by my sh</td><td></td><td>aa ae ai oe oi</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>As described in the article, a player simply needs to remember the
      phrases for each of the vowels (and the leftover words at the bottom), and
      they will be able to determine if a combination of two letters is a valid
      word or not. Actually knowing the definition of said 2-letter word is
      irrelevant (case in point, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11753524/French-scrabble-champion-doesnt-speak-French.html">a New Zealander who speaks no French won the
        French-language Scrabble world championship</a>), though learning the words'
      definitions can be helpful for further ingraining it in one's memory or
      making it easier to recognize as a word.</p>

      <p>2-letter words can also be relatively useful in 4x4 Boggle play, as
      many of these words can take an '-S' suffix, giving one a jump start on
      learning the 3-letter words. Playing a letter before or after an existing
      word is known as "<b>hooking</b>", and it is already demonstrated in the
      table above, as the consonants which can be 'hooked' onto a vowel are
      encoded in the phrases. In Scrabble and Bananagrams, hooking is central
      to the game as it's the only way a player is able to play their word -
      they must build off an existing word. In Boggle, the concept of hooks is
      still useful for building up one's vocabulary in more manageable pieces
      and also in game - after discovering a pocket of tiles, one can then look
      around the neighbouring tiles for known hooks to potential form
      additional words.  </p>

      <p>In Scrabble and Bananagrams, learning the 2- and 3-letter words and
      their hooks (and especially which can be pluralized) is usually the best
      place to start, as we can assume these words will appear most frequently
      and be used to join new words to the board. With Boggle, these words are
      still important (and there's only ~1000 3-letter words), but Boggle
      actually has a unique property compared to the other games in that the
      state of the board is completely determined from the beginning of the
      game, independent of input from the players. As such, one can actually
      randomly generate hundreds of millions of boards and track which words
      occur most often in aggregate, and then use the <b>expected points</b>
      each word will garner in an average game to prioritize which to study
      first (thanks to Luke Gustafson and Craig S. Kaplan for this idea).</p>

      <p>The word frequency stats from Boggle games in aggregate shows that
      most words on a board are going to be 3-7 characters long, with the most
      between 3-5 (or 4-6 in Big Boggle). As such, Boggle favours the ability to
      recognize to an even greater extent than Bananagrams or Scrabble where
      longer words have more advantages. There are several other important
      tactical considerations when playing or learning Boggle:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Anagrams:</b> as mentioned from the beginning, deciphering
          various anagrams from scrambled letters is the core of word games. In
          Boggle, if a player encounters a cluster of letters and recognizes
          one word from an anagram group, the player can then test to see if
          any of the other words that are known anagrams of the word played can
          also be played. This narrows the search dramatically from one which
          is more exploratory to one which is surgical in nature and greatly
          speeds up identifying words and helps avoid overlooking words.</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anadrome"><b>Anadromes:</b></a>
          a special case of anagram, anadromes form 'pairs' which can simplify
          learning and playing words to a great extent - unlike anagram groups
          where some members of the group may not be playable due to the
          configuration of the board, if a player finds one half of an anadrome
          pair they immediately know that its partner must exist and can write
          down the partner word without even looking at the board.
          Furthermore, anadromes simplify memorizing words considerably, as its
          only necessary to remember a word has an anadrome, not what the
          anadrome means or even looks like. eg. A player who remembers that
          <tt>LION</tt> has an anadrome can immediately write down the
          reverse of <tt>LION</tt> (<tt>NOIL</tt>, <i>"short fibers
          combed from long fibers during textile preparation"</i>),
          effectively reducing the amount of information they need to
          memorize from being an entire other word to simply an extra bit of
          information attached to a word they already know.</li>
        <li><b>Subwords:</b> players will more often look to build longer words
          through hooking and sometimes miss looking inside the words they've
          already found: eg. missing <tt>LOO</tt> after jumping immediately
          to <tt>LOOT</tt>. This often occurs when the subword is more
          esoteric than the longer word (<tt>OPE</tt> vs. <tt>OPEN</tt>).</li>
        <li><b>Search Optimization:</b> players should aim to spend most of their
          time looking in the areas of the board most likely to contain the most
          scoring words, which often means not spending too much time trying to
          make words out 'Qu', 'K', Z', etc and instead looking to build around
          vowels and other promising groups of characters.</li>
        <li><b>Suffixes/Prefixes:</b> one of the most basic strategies players learn
          for Boggle is to always been on the lookout to see if a common suffix
          such as  <tt>-S</tt>, <tt>-ER</tt>, <tt>-ED</tt>,  or
          <tt>-ING</tt> exists on the board and then trying to look for words
          around those suffixes. This is effectively a combination of hooking
          and looking in areas likely to have higher clusters of points. This
          practice can also be applied to common prefixes such as
          <tt>RE-</tt> or <tt>DE-</tt>, though these occur with less
          regularity than the suffixes mentioned above (it's also worth noting
          that <tt>-ING</tt> isn't actually that common a suffix when you take
          into account dice distributions and expected points per game).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Playing games like Bananagrams and Scrabble involve slightly different
      strategies, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Dumping:</b> stronger players tend to be more willing to take
          the tradeoff of missing their turn/gaining more letters to get rid of
          a bad slate of tiles. In Scrabble, longer words (and especially
          bingos) that you can more easily play to stretch to word bonuses are
          going to earn disproportionately more points in the long run. In both
          games, trading off undesirable letters in the hopes of achieving a better
          composition of characters to work with is an important skill to
          master.</li>
        <li><b>Difficult Letters:</b> while knowing when to dump difficult
          letters is important, players should also take care to study the
          easiest ways to utilize these letters in their play. While in Boggle
          difficult letters can (and for the most part, should) be avoided, in
          Scrabble and Bananagrams you are often placed in a position where you
          are to come up with a use for a 'Q' or 'Z' or need a word that uses up an
          excess of consonants or vowels. In Bananagrams it is worth considering
          leaving open an 'A', 'I', or 'O' available be able to use in case a 'Z',
          'K', 'X', 'Q' or 'J' arises. In Scrabble, more difficult letters are
          assigned higher points, so it is often worth saving them to play on bonus
          squares and learning how to use them in longer words such that they can
          actually serve as a benefit rather than a roadblock.</li>
        <li><b>Open Board Position:</b> high level Scrabble and Bananagram
          players will look to build a board that is as 'open' as possible,
          favoring longer words sprawled out as opposed to a board which is
          compact and hard to play off of. An open board position provides more
          opportunities to play high scoring words in Scrabble (and in
          particular, to reach bonus squares on the board) and provides more space
          to play words in Bananagrams.</li>
        <li><b>Restructuring:</b> in Bananagrams a player should constantly be
          willing to restructure their board as needed. The board state in
          Bananagrams is not set in stone, once played a word may later be
          removed and rearranged to form other words. Because of this, players
          should always be on the lookout for opportunities to remove words in
          order to build long words from the tiles (to achieve a more open board
          position, as discussed above) and, in particular, to use difficult
          letters. A very powerful tactic in Bananagrams for dealing with a difficult
          letter is to find a place for it in your existing board by swapping out a
          more common and easy to use letter, with the expectation that it will be much
          easier to then find a new home for the letter it replaced.</li>
        <li><b>Bonuses/Bingos:</b> word/letter bonuses (eg. triple letter
          score) and bingos (when a player uses all 7 of their tiles in one
          turn and earns a 50 point bonus) are incredibly important to consider
          at higher level play - among experts the winner, on average, out-bingos
          the loser 2:1. Maintaining an open board position as mentioned above is
          important for facilitating this, but for Scrabble it's also important to
          <a href="http://oldtownscrabble.com/05/12/bingo-stems-study-grids/">
          study the most common 6-7 letter stems that can be turned into bingos</a>.
          <a href="http://oldtownscrabble.com/05/12/bingo-stems/">Old Town Scrabble
          explains bingo stems in more detail</a>, but for example, 70 other words can
          be made by the addition of one letter to the 6 tiles in <tt>SATIRE</tt>.</li>
      </ul>


      <h3 id="training-algorithm">Training Algorithm</h3>

      <p>Words are learned alongside their anagrams, with new groups being
      introduced in order of the groups' average total expected points per game.
      The trainee's ratings are then plugged into the standard
      <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2">SM2</a>
      algorithm, with a small number of enhancements and the now standard 3 day review
      period. Like with
      <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#what-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-anki-use">Anki</a>,
      failures during the initial 'learning' phase of a group (the first 5
      times the group has been seen) are treated less harshly, with the
      modifier applied to the difficulty rating only progressively approaching
      its full value. Furthermore, if a group is
      corrected remembered after its due date, a
      <a href="http://www.blueraja.com/blog/477/a-better-spaced-repetition-learning-algorithm-sm2">bonus</a>
      is applied to reduce its difficulty.</p>

      <p>Because the training mode is built into the same application as the
      game, it seems like it would be possible to use in-game experience to
      objectively adjust training weights of anagram groups identified in game.
      Unfortunately, there are a number of reasons why this is difficult:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>training mode deals in anagram groups, not the individual words, and
          on a real board entire anagram groups are not always present</li>
        <li>missing a word on the board does not necessary imply it was not
          remember - real games have time pressure and the player may have
          simply prioritized other areas of the board to focus on</li>
        <li>games are not all played to exhaustion or even until the timer has
          expired and it is difficult to eliminate false negatives</li>
        <li>words may be easy to overlook on a board but also easy to solve in
          training (different modalities)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Instead, the <a href="#stats">stats</a> section was designed with the
      hopes of surfacing the same sorts of actionable information based on
      trying to use feedback from the game history.</p>

      <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

      <p>The main challenge with implementing Boggle is the size of the
      dictionary - ranging from ~180,000 - 280,000 words depending on which
      dictionary is used, even just the words themselves stored in a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton">
      deterministic acyclic finite state automaton</a> or an
      <a href="http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=120">efficiently compressed trie</a>
      still take up around 2MB. Furthermore, since the application shows
      definitions by default on successful entry of word it ends up requiring
      the full dictionary anyway which balloons the size up 10-15x.
      Unfortunately, this has a large impact on initial startup as downloading
      a 30MB dictionary anywhere is going to be slow.</p>

      <p>If supporting offline was not a requirement the application could
      compute board solutions server side and send down only the required
      definitions and words for the game (or do point lookups on demand for
      something like define mode). Even with the need to support offline mode
      the initial download could be slightly optimized by shipping down just the
      encoded word data structure without definitions (and only for the specific
      dictionary configuration, given CSW is ~50% larger than the other two) so
      that the initial board could be solved and then shipping down definitions
      in a secondary download so that the user could begin playing immediately
      (racing the definitions download), however this approach was not chosen as
      either not showing the definitions before the second download has
      completed or blocking input on the board until the downloads are
      undesirable.</p>

      <p>As such, the best that can be done is attempting to hiding the latency
      (and the dreaded loading spinner UI) of the dictionary download by
      inserting the menu splash instead of dropping the user directly into a
      game and using the Service Worker API to cache the dictionary to make
      future loads as fast as possible. Given the number of features and modes
      supported by the application the menu as the loading screen isn't actually
      a terrible UX decision, and if the user hesitates long enough on choosing
      where they wish to navigate to the entirety of the dictionary download may
      have time to finish in the background.</p>

      <p>Computing the training set or processing game history can also cause
      problems as they grow linearly. The training set thankfully grows fairly
      slowly because it is bound by human memory, though it is still relatively
      expensive to initially compute as it involves iterating through the
      entirety of the dictionary. Saving the history of each game played also is
      problematic as the longer a user uses the application the slower their
      experience will get, however, its possible to minimize this impact by
      bounding the amount of recent history we look at (eg. only looking at the
      last 500 games for stats) or by lazy loading (as is done in the past
      scoring breakdown).</p>
